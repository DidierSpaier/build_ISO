The directory ../sets hosts sets, or lists, of packages. These files are read by:
1. ../build/populate_iso_dir to select the packages to ship in the ISO
  This includes:
  a. packages that will be installed, stored in te ISO in  /slint regardless of the to-be-installed
     distribution,
  b. packages to be added to the initramfs by /etc/rc.d/rc.S when starting the installer after
     having expanded the usable RAM setting swap in zram.
     As these packages should always comme for a Slint repository, in case of installing another
     distribution they are isolated in the /installer repository of the ISO. This way is to avoid
     that when installing Salix or Slackware packages Slint packages be selected.   
2. /sbin/functions during installation to select the packages to install aaa_base is installed first
   (function aabaseandfixperms) then the function installfirstpackages => set boostrap<distribution> 

These sets are used to list the packages to be included in the ISO,
including those to be installed and those to be added to the genuine 
Slackware initrd 

<distribution> below can be salix, slackware or slint. 

aaa_base: package to be installed first
addonsinstaller: packages added to the installer by /etc/rc.d/rc.S, put
  in the directory installer of the ISO if distribution is not Slint.
bootstrapslint: slint packages to be installed before all other sets but aaa_base
